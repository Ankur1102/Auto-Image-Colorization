In this project, we present our efforts to
implement a deep learning-based image colorization model
using the PyTorch framework. We draw inspiration from
Richard Zhang's "Colorful Image Colorization" model and
attempt to recreate it using PyTorch. This model focuses on
converting grayscale images to color images by leveraging the
LAB color space. The primary goal of our work is to leverage
the power of deep convolutional neural networks to
automatically learn high-level features and to accurately fill in
the missing color information in grayscale images. We discuss
the challenges faced during the conversion from Caffe to
PyTorch and how we overcame them to develop the image
colorization model. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in generating visually appealing and
semantically meaningful colorized images.
